# projects by team emerald

## here are the planning documents for our projects.

as we work through our projects documentation on the early planning stages can go here so we all know what we are aiming for but also allow contributions after the fact in case there is something missing that should be accounted for.

### this repository does not contain the actual projects themselves, but will link to them accordingly.

# project categories
## small
projects that fit well for this category are the ones you often see on portfolios where developers tackle many little projects, like landing pages, tribute pages, a simple blog, their own portfolio itself etc.

## medium
project scope for this category is still being figured out, one good suggestion thus far was to make a webscraper, potentially built into a browser extension.

## big
project(s) for this category should be full-stack, encompassing many moving parts to create a cohesive experience. our first project being a blackjack game will have a vast array of bits n pieces and so will take time and a lot of organisational effort from us all to complete it.
